About
=====

Jungle is a simple JRuby application demonstrating the integration of the powerful Java libraries and the awesome Ruby Gems. A mapping application with a simple search function in which you can search for contintents, countries, cities or streets. The maps are provided by OpenStreetMaps.

In this application I have used SwingX and SwingX-WS libraries provided by SwingLabs for the mapping functionality and the Geocoder Ruby gem for geocoding the addresses.

Running
=======
First install the dependencies with bundle:

 bundle

I hope you are using RVM and then for running just type:

 rake

to start the application, otherwise:

 jruby --1.9 jungle.rb

of course JRuby needs to be installed.
